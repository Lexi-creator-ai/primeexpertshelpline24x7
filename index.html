        <h2>Steps to Activate Prime Video on Your TV</h2>
        <p>Follow these official steps to activate Amazon Prime Video on your smart TV or streaming device. If you need assistance at any point, call our helpline at +1-888-766-1625.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Download and install the Prime Video app from your device's app store (e.g., on your smart TV, Roku, Fire TV, etc.).</li>
            <li>Open the Prime Video app on your device.</li>
            <li>Select "Sign in and start watching" if you want to enter your Amazon account details directly on the device (not recommended for TVs with poor keyboards).</li>
            <li>Alternatively, choose "Register on the Amazon website" to receive a 5-6 character activation code displayed on your screen.</li>
            <li>On a separate device (like a computer or smartphone), go to the official Amazon website: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amazon.com/code</a>.</li>
            <li>Sign in to your Amazon account.</li>
            <li>Enter the activation code shown on your TV and select "Register Device."</li>
            <li>Your device should now be activated, and you can start streaming. If you face any errors, such as code not working or login issues, contact us for support.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="disclaimer">Note: Always use the official Amazon website for entering codes to ensure security. We do not handle code entry; our support is via phone guidance only.</p>
